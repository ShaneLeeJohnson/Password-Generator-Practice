To use this application the user will first select the length they want the password to be by typing in a number between 8 and 128. The user will then be prompted on if they want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or symbols. The user will need to select at least one type of character to generate a password. All of the users choices will come together to create a random password of the chosen length using the selected characters. The password will be displayed in the textbox that initially says "Your Secure Password" and the user can copy and paste the password anywhere they would like.
